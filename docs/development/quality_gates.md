# Quality Gates

Pyne Runtime is intended to be developed and tested as an independent package.

## Local Setup

From the repository root:

```bash
python -m pip install -e .[dev]
```

## Required Checks

Run these before committing package changes:

```bash
python -m compileall src tests -q
python -m ruff check .
python -m pytest tests/test_architecture.py -q
python -m pytest -q
python scripts/performance_smoke.py --check
python scripts/incremental_stability_smoke.py --check
python scripts/request_capture_diff.py --assertion parity
python scripts/strategy_capture_scaffold.py --check
python scripts/strategy_capture_diff.py --assertion parity
python scripts/ta_capture_diff.py --assertion parity
git diff --check
```

When the package is not installed in editable mode, set `PYTHONPATH=src` before
running pytest. On PowerShell from the repository root:

```powershell
$env:PYTHONPATH='h:\program\pyne-runtime\src'
python -m pytest -q
```

## Architecture Checks

Architecture guard tests live in `tests/test_architecture.py`. Run them directly when
moving modules or changing public package exports:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_architecture.py -q
```

These checks verify that:

- every name in `pyne_runtime.__all__` is importable;
- core package modules do not import host application modules such as `app` or
  `candlescope`;
- the internal `pyne_runtime` import graph has no static cycles;
- unusually large modules emit a warning for architecture review without failing
  the test suite.

Golden-style semantic fixtures live under `tests/golden/` and are exercised by
the normal pytest suite. Add or update a fixture when a Pine-like compatibility
claim depends on exact alignment or replay output, especially for
`request.security` gaps/lookahead alignment, lower-timeframe grouping, strategy
fills, and barstate flags.

`performance_smoke.py` protects the algorithmic growth contracts that are easy
to miss in semantic fixtures: dense strategy replay time and memory,
incremental window indexing, multi-session scaling, bounded retained-memory
growth, portable snapshot/restore scaling, typed-state-v2 versus replay-v1
restore cost, trace-v2 opt-in overhead, long-period monotonic and pivot checks,
TA NaN fast paths, weighted averages, and rolling order statistics. It
uses relative growth ratios rather than machine-specific absolute latency
budgets. Portable restore uses alternating small/large pairs, reports every raw
sample, and gates the median paired ratio. The typed-state and trace comparisons
use the same alternating raw-sample contract. The non-JSON output also prints
both measured values so a failure is auditable without rerunning the gate.

`incremental_stability_smoke.py` exercises multiple isolated sessions through
longer streams and checks retention bounds, deterministic portable snapshot
bytes, restore equivalence, and preview isolation. The full PowerShell quality
gate runs it after the relative performance checks.

The request capture gate protects TradingView-backed `request.security()`
evidence. Captured `parity` fixtures must stay at 0 diff with
`request_capture_diff.py --assertion parity`, and the HTF parity fixture is also
exercised by `tests/test_golden_request_security.py`.

The strategy capture gates protect the TradingView external-evidence workflow:
`strategy_capture_scaffold.py --check` ensures every strategy pine-equivalent
case keeps an `external_capture` contract. Captured TradingView data can be used
in two assertion modes: `reference` captures are preserved as external evidence
and inspected with `strategy_capture_diff.py --assertion reference` or
`strategy_capture_diff.py --assertion all`, while `parity` captures are expected
to match current Pyne output in the golden tests and the package quality gate.
Use `strategy_capture_diff.py --assertion all --summary` when you need a grouped
case/plot view of captured differences across both modes.

## Phase-Focused Checks

Use focused checks during architecture work, then finish with the full gate:

```bash
python -m pytest \
  tests/test_golden_strategy.py \
  tests/test_strategy_runtime.py \
  tests/test_incremental.py \
  -q
python -m pytest tests/test_request_security.py tests/test_golden_request_security.py -q
python -m pytest tests/test_plot_runtime.py tests/test_result.py -q
python -m pytest tests/test_input_runtime.py tests/test_examples.py -q
python -m pytest \
  tests/test_smoke.py \
  tests/test_api.py \
  tests/test_cli.py \
  tests/test_cli_contracts.py \
  -q
```

The architecture guard should be run whenever public exports, package layout,
or namespace assembly changes:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_architecture.py -q
```

From the package root, the full package check also verifies build metadata:

```bash
scripts/check.ps1
```

On POSIX shells:

```bash
scripts/check.sh
```

The full package check builds into a temporary directory, runs
`python -m twine check`, installs the built wheel into a temporary virtualenv,
verifies the installed `py.typed` marker, and exercises the installed CLI with
`pyne --version`, `pyne schema`, `pyne validate`, and `pyne run`.
The scripts use per-run subdirectories under the ignored `.pyne-check-tmp`
directory as their pytest/build temporary root so the gate does not depend on
system temp directory permissions or stale pytest cleanup artifacts. Set
`PYNE_CHECK_TMP=/path/to/tmp` to override that location.
They also build with `python -m build --no-isolation`, so install the dev
extras first with `python -m pip install -e .[dev]`.
The package smoke step uses `scripts/package_smoke.py --offline`, which installs
the just-built wheel with `--no-deps` and `PIP_NO_INDEX`. After creating the
temporary venv, offline smoke queries the supplied `--python` interpreter (not
the driver process) for `sysconfig` `purelib`/`platlib` and writes a `.pth` file
into the child venv site-packages listing those existing absolute directories.
That appends the calling environment's dependency dirs after the child
site-packages so local packages such as numpy remain importable without an
index, without `site.addsitedir` on the parent, and without processing parent
`.pth` or editable hooks. `--system-site-packages` still uses the base
interpreter site; the `.pth` is what inherits the `--python` environment. The
installed wheel must still resolve from the temporary venv, not repository
`src` or a parent `pyne_runtime`. This keeps the gate runnable without
package-index access while still checking wheel contents, CLI entry points,
schema output, and example
execution. After those CLI checks, smoke invokes
`scripts/installed_runtime_acceptance.py` with the same temporary wheel
interpreter and sanitized environment. That helper must not import pytest,
`tests`, or `semantic_workload_benchmark`, must not insert repository `src` onto
`sys.path`, and must fail if `pyne_runtime.__file__` is outside the expected
venv prefix. It reads migration and snapshot fixtures as data and exercises
batch/incremental ADX-DI capture, naive inspect/run failure, preview isolation,
typed-state restore, and pre-compat snapshot rejection
(`PYNE_SNAPSHOT_SEMANTICS_MISMATCH`) plus independent current EMA arithmetic.
The smoke subprocesses remove inherited Python source-path settings
and assert that `pyne_runtime.__file__` resolves inside the temporary venv, not
the repository `src` tree.

GitHub `CI` builds the wheel and source distribution once, uploads that single
`pyne-runtime-dist` artifact, and runs `scripts/package_smoke.py --dist-dir dist`
on Linux, Windows, and macOS for Python 3.11, 3.12, and 3.13. Each of those
nine jobs downloads the same build artifact; they do not rebuild. Source tests
remain a separate matrix and still use an editable install.

## Independence Check

Package code must not import CandleScope application modules. The architecture
tests enforce this with AST scanning. For a quick manual check, this should
return no matches:

```bash
Select-String -Path src/pyne_runtime/*.py -Pattern 'from app\.|import app\.|app\.'
```

## Release Readiness

The full release flow and versioning policy live in
[Release Process](../reference/release_process.md).

A release candidate is ready only when:

- package tests pass in a clean virtual environment;
- CLI smoke tests pass with `pyne run`, `pyne validate`, `pyne schema`, and `pyne --version`;
- `python -m build` creates both wheel and source distribution;
- `python -m twine check` passes for built artifacts;
- `python scripts/package_smoke.py --dist-dir <dist>` passes against the built wheel;
- GitHub installed-wheel smoke passes on Linux, Windows, and macOS for Python
  3.11, 3.12, and 3.13 against that same built wheel;
- documentation and changelog reflect public API changes.
